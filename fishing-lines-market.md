<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Fishing Lines Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Braided</li><li>Monofilament</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The fishing lines market is divided into two main types: braided and monofilament lines. Braided lines are made up of multiple strands of synthetic fibers, tightly woven together, providing superior strength and sensitivity.

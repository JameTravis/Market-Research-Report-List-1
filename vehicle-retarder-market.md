<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Vehicle Retarder Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Electric retarders</li><li>Hydraulic retarder</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The vehicle retarder market consists of two main types: electric retarders and hydraulic retarders. Electric retarders are braking systems that use the vehicle's electrical energy to generate resistance and slow down the vehicle's speed. On the other hand, hydraulic retarders use hydraulic fluid to generate resistance and reduce the speed of the vehicle. Both electric and hydraulic retarders are effective in enhancing vehicle safety and reducing wear on the traditional braking system, providing reliable and efficient braking options for different types of vehicles.</p></p>

<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Indirect Tire Pressure Monitoring System (iTPMS) Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Sensor-Type</li><li>ECU-Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The indirect Tire Pressure Monitoring System (iTPMS) market is categorized into two types: Sensor-Type and ECU-Type. In the Sensor-Type market, pressure sensors are installed in each tire to monitor the tire's pressure individually. These sensors wirelessly communicate with the vehicle's onboard computer to provide real-time pressure information to the driver. On the other hand, the ECU-Type market uses the vehicle's existing Anti-lock Braking System (ABS) sensors to indirectly calculate tire pressure based on other vehicle dynamics. Both types aim to improve safety on the road by alerting drivers of low tire pressure and preventing potential accidents.</p></p>

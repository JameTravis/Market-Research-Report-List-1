<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The HVAC Damper Actuators Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Spring Return Damper Actuators</li><li>Non-Spring Return Damper Actuators</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The HVAC damper actuator market can be categorized into two types: spring return damper actuators and non-spring return damper actuators. Spring return damper actuators use a spring mechanism to move the damper to its default position when the actuator is not receiving power. On the other hand, non-spring return damper actuators require continuous power to maintain their position. Both types have their own advantages and are used in different applications depending on the requirements of the HVAC system.</p></p>

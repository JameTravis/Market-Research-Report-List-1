<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Automotive Radiator Fan Motors Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Mechanical Type</li><li>Electric Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The automotive radiator fan motors market includes two primary types: mechanical type and electric type. Mechanical type radiator fan motors are driven by the engine's mechanical power and are typically belt-driven. They function by pulling air through the radiator to cool the engine. On the other hand, electric type radiator fan motors are powered by electricity and operate independently of the engine. They are controlled by sensors and switches and can operate at variable speeds as needed to maintain optimum engine temperature.</p></p>

<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Selective Catalytic Reduction for Diesel Commercial Vehicles Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>NH3-SCR</li><li>Urea-SCR</li><li>Ammonia-SCR</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) is a technology used in diesel commercial vehicles to reduce nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions. There are three main types of SCR systems: NH3-SCR, Urea-SCR, and Ammonia-SCR. NH3-SCR uses ammonia as the reducing agent, while Urea-SCR utilizes urea as the reducing agent. Ammonia-SCR involves the direct use of ammonia as the reducing agent. These SCR systems work by injecting the reducing agent into the vehicle's exhaust stream, where it reacts with NOx to convert it into harmless nitrogen and water, thus minimizing the vehicle's environmental impact.</p></p>

<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Waterproof Breathable Textiles (WBT) Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>PTFE</li><li>EPFE</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Waterproof Breathable Textiles (WBT) are fabrics that allow water vapor to pass through while preventing water from entering. There are two main types in the market: PTFE and ePTFE. PTFE (polytetrafluoroethylene) membranes consist of tiny pores that are too small for liquid water to pass through but large enough for water vapor, providing breathability. ePTFE (expanded polytetrafluoroethylene) membranes have a porous structure with billions of micro-pores, allowing moisture vapor to escape efficiently. Both types offer effective water resistance and breathability, catering to different needs and preferences in various industries, including outdoor apparel and sports gear.</p></p>

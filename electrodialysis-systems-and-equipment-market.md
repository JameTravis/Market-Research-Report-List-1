<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Electrodialysis Systems and Equipment Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Continuous Electrodialysis</li><li>Batch Electrodialysis</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Electrodialysis Systems and Equipment are used for the separation and concentration of ions in a solution. Continuous Electrodialysis involves a continuous flow of feed solution and product separation, making it suitable for large-scale operations. Batch Electrodialysis, on the other hand, involves intermittent operation, making it more suitable for small-scale operations or when variable product quality is acceptable. Both types of systems employ a stack of ion-selective membranes and electrodes to create an electric field that drives the movement of ions across the membranes, facilitating the separation process.</p></p>

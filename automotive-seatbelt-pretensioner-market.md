<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Automotive Seatbelt Pretensioner Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Buckle Pretensioner</li><li>Retractor Pretensioner</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The automotive seatbelt pretensioner market consists of two major types: buckle pretensioner and retractor pretensioner. Buckle pretensioners enhance safety by pulling the seatbelt tighter around the occupant during a sudden impact or collision. They achieve this by employing an electric actuator or explosive charge. Retractor pretensioners, on the other hand, are built into the seatbelt retractor mechanism. They work by automatically tightening the seatbelt when a collision or sudden deceleration is detected, reducing potential injury to the occupant by restraining them more firmly in their seat.</p></p>

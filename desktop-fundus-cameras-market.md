<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Desktop Fundus Cameras Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Mydriatic Fundus Camera</li><li>Non-Mydriatic Fundus Camera</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The desktop fundus cameras market consists of two main types: Mydriatic Fundus Camera and Non-Mydriatic Fundus Camera. Mydriatic Fundus Cameras require the use of dilating eye drops to enlarge the pupil for better imaging, allowing for detailed examination of the retina. On the other hand, Non-Mydriatic Fundus Cameras do not require the use of eye drops as they can capture images through a smaller pupil size, albeit with slightly lower image quality. Both types of cameras are commonly used for diagnosing and monitoring various eye conditions.</p></p>

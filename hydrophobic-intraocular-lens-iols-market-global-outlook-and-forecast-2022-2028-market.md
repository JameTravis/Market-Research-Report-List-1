<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The global hydrophobic intraocular lens (IOLs) market is expected to witness significant growth during the forecast period of 2022-2028. There are two main types of IOLs in this market: not pre-loaded IOLs and pre-loaded IOLs. Not pre-loaded IOLs are lenses that need to be manually loaded into an injector prior to surgery, while pre-loaded IOLs come ready to use. These IOLs are designed to be hydrophobic, meaning they repel water, which reduces the risk of complications such as posterior capsule opacification and allows for better visual outcomes for patients.</p></p>

<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Antidiabetic Drug Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Alpha-Glucosidase Inhibitors</li><li>Biguanides, Sulphonylureas</li><li>Glp-1 Agonist</li><li>Meglitinides</li><li>Dpp-4 Inhibitors</li><li>Sglt-2</li><li>Thiazolodinediones</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The antidiabetic drug market encompasses various types of medications that help manage diabetes. Alpha-glucosidase inhibitors, such as acarbose, slow down the digestion of carbohydrates. Biguanides, like metformin, lower glucose production in the liver. Sulphonylureas, including glibenclamide, stimulate insulin secretion. GLP-1 agonists, such as exenatide, increase insulin production and reduce appetite. Meglitinides, like repaglinide, prompt the pancreas to release insulin. DPP-4 inhibitors, including sitagliptin, increase insulin levels and lower blood glucose. SGLT-2 inhibitors, like canagliflozin, help the kidneys remove excess glucose. Thiazolodinediones, such as pioglitazone, make cells more sensitive to insulin.</p></p>

<p><strong>The Antidiabetic Drug Market Industry Research by Application is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Type I Diabetes</li><li>Type II Diabetes</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Antidiabetic Drug Market application comprises two major segments, Type I Diabetes and Type II Diabetes. Type I Diabetes, also known as insulin-dependent diabetes, occurs when the body's immune system destroys insulin-producing cells. Consequently, patients require external insulin administration. Type II Diabetes, on the other hand, is characterized by insulin resistance or insufficient insulin production. Antidiabetic drugs are utilized to manage blood sugar levels in both types of diabetes, with Type II Diabetes being more prevalent. These medications help regulate glucose levels and prevent complications associated with diabetes.</p></p>
